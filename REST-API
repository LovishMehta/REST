-> Understanding Representational State Transfer(REST)
-> Resources/ Nouns vs Actions
-> Breaking down the definition of REST
   - What is Representation
   - What is State?Does it mean session state
   - What is transfer?
   - Understanding the definition put together
-> Set of Architectural Constraints
-> Introducing JSON in REST
-> Introducing HTTP protocol

Need of Rest API
->Softwares are Huge and complex, so they place numerous demands on software architectures.
  We need seperated client and server. In rest we have separate client and server. And both the server and client
  can evolve sepaerately. This means rest allows you to built loosely coupled application. Client may work on angular
  and server might work on Reactjs. Client and server need not worry about each other technology so that both evolve 
  independently.
-> Rest is independent of platforms and languaes
-> Flexibility and scalability
-> Not constrained to one format. Can return (XML,JSON,etc)
-> Since built on top of HTTP, can take advantageof HTTP cache.
-> Easy to use
-> Discoverability

What is web?
Interconnected Networks

What is API?
Application programming Interface.It is used to connect systems working on different platforms

What is a web server? Why we need it?
Interprets the client request and prepares the response for the client. That software is called web server.
Ex. IIS

Why we need web API?
Because we have distributed nature of web applications.
Example I have an application which has maps and order portal. So I used google API
to use google maps service and amazon API to use order service. Now to communicate between distributed
web applications we need Web API.

Web API is a technolgy offered by microsoft to build REST API's.

SOAP
-> Another category of API exists called SOAP
What is SOAP?
-> Simple Object Access Protocol
-> Can be built using WCF (windows communication foundation)
-> Return XML
-> Web services are nothing but SOAP services.
(whenever somebody says web API it means REST api and whenever somebody days Web API it means Web Services)

Q) Which one is prefered, SOAP or REST? Why?
SOAP and REST categorize to different needs of different set of software applications.
->Rest is an architectural style
->SOAP is a protocol
(So no comparision b/w both)
