Richardson Maturity Model is a model developd by Leonard Richardson
-> It grades APIs by their restful maturity.

-> Thereare 4 levels. Only when the APIs reach the level 4, we can talk about restful APIs.
The levels are
 - Level 0 
 - Level 1
 - Level 2
 - Level 3
 -> Level 4: REST API
 
 -> Level 0- Plain old XML and there is only one URI
    - HTTP is used only as a transport protocol. HTTP is used for remote interaction.
    - To get the data and to post data we send request to same URL.
    - We use only one method of HTTP i.e POST
    E.g.
     -To get the data
       POST http://localhost:400/customer
     
     -To post the data
       POST http://localhost:400/customer
  
  -> Level 1- In level 1, each resource is mapped to a specific URI,
        For example: the URI to get products
        http://localhost:2300/products
        
        To get URI for a specific product
        http://localhost:2300/product/1
        
        Still only one HTTP method (POST) is still used for retrieving & creating data.
   
   -> Level 2, correct verbs are used with each request
        For get we use http get
        For put we use http put
        For post we use http post
        For delete we use http delete
      - For each of those requests, correct HTTP response code is provided.
      - Example 
           GET http://localhost:2300/customers
           200 OK
    
   -> Level 3, it has features provided in lvl 1&2 and other than that it has APIs support for HATEOS
      - Example 
           GET http://localhost:2300/customers 
           for this, the response that we get is Customer JSON + Self documenting Hypermedia( linkswhich basically tells that my customer might have placed)
           
        - Helps in Self-documentation
